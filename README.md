# Proxy and CORS Example

This repository serves as a straightforward illustration of utilizing proxies from the frontend as a means to overcome Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) limitations from the backend.

## CORS Overview

CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a crucial security feature implemented by web browsers. Its primary purpose is to regulate how web pages from one domain can make requests and interact with resources hosted on another domain. The Same-Origin Policy, a security measure in browsers, typically restricts cross-origin requests. However, CORS provides a controlled approach to relax these restrictions.

### Key Points:

- **Security Measure:** CORS enhances security by managing and defining which web domains are permitted to access resources hosted on a different domain.
- **Same-Origin Policy:** By default, web pages are restricted from making requests to domains other than the one that served the web page.
- **Controlled Conditions:** CORS allows controlled relaxation of these restrictions under specific, defined conditions.

## Proxy Server

A proxy server serves as an intermediary between a client, often a web browser, and a destination server. Below is a concise explanation of proxy servers and their applications:

- **Anonymity and Privacy:** Proxies can be used to conceal the client's IP address, providing a level of anonymity and privacy.
- **Content Filtering:** Proxies enable content filtering, useful for organizations and schools to restrict access to specific websites or content types.
- **Access Control:** Proxies can control and restrict access to resources based on criteria like IP addresses, geographical locations, or user authentication.
- **Caching:** Proxies can cache frequently requested resources, reducing load on the destination server and improving response times.
- **Load Balancing:** Proxies distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers, balancing the load and enhancing performance.
- **Security:** Proxies add a security layer by filtering and inspecting incoming and outgoing traffic, protecting against various attacks.

In summary, this repository demonstrates how proxies from the frontend can be employed as a practical solution for handling CORS challenges from the backend.
